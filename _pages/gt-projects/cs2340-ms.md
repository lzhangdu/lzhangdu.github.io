## About Me

I'm an undergraduate student double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), currently on an exchange program at Georgia Tech to broaden my academic horizons. Driven by a passion for the interdisciplinary depths of computing, I'm particularly fascinated by the intersection of mathematical theory and practical software development. I'm eager to participate in research projects and contribute to advancing this visually compelling field, while continuing to build innovative solutions through hands-on projects like the one showcased here.

## GT Movies Store: Comprehensive Project Description

GT Movies Store is a full-featured e-commerce web application built with Django that allows users to browse, search, and purchase movies online. The application was designed and developed to meet specific user stories, ensuring functionality aligns with user needs.

**Technical Stack**: Django, Python, SQLite, Bootstrap 5, HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Development Process & Methodology

### Development Approach

I followed a structured four-phase development methodology:

**Phase 1: Foundation & Setup**
- Created isolated Python environment using venv
- Established Django project structure with proper configuration
- Implemented version control with comprehensive .gitignore
- Set up development database and initial dependencies

**Phase 2: Data Modeling & Administration**
- Designed relational database schema with proper relationships
- Implemented Django models for Movies, Reviews, Orders, and OrderItems
- Created admin interface with customized display options
- Established media handling for movie images

**Phase 3: Core Functionality Implementation**
- Developed authentication system with custom registration form
- Built movie browsing and search functionality
- Implemented session-based shopping cart
- Created review system with user permissions

**Phase 4: Polish & Testing**
- Applied Bootstrap styling for responsive design
- Conducted comprehensive user story validation
- Performed cross-browser compatibility testing

### Problem-Solving Approach

Throughout development, I employed several strategies to overcome challenges:

1. **Technical Research**: Leveraged Django documentation and Stack Overflow for specific implementation questions
2. **Systematic Debugging**: Used Django's built-in development server and debug toolbar for issue identification
3. **User-Centric Validation**: Continuously tested features against the original user stories to ensure requirements were met
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Built core functionality first, then added advanced features and styling

The most significant challenges included implementing persistent session-based shopping carts, managing database relationships between orders and order items, and creating a responsive design that worked across all device sizes.
